Subject: [PATCH] Settings.c: show thread names by default

This is to support analysis of multi-threaded applications "out of the
box", like web browsers. Applications can name their threads, so this
change should prove useful.

$HOME/.conf/htop/htoprc is written whenever the user changes settings in
htop. If users have a "show_thread_names=0" line in htoprc, this change
will not override it.
